I am a Year-0 PhD student at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, advised by [Prof. Yao Mu](https://yaomarkmu.github.io/).

Currently I'm pursuing my Bachelor’s degree as a Year-4 undergraduate from the School of Future Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology, where I was advised by [Prof. Wangmeng Zuo](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rUOpCEYAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. Zhilu Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8pIq2N0AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). During my undergraduate studies, I worked on monocular 4D reconstruction of hand–object interactions involving articulated objects.

My current research focuses on Dexterous Manipulation and Pretraining from large-scale human videos.
